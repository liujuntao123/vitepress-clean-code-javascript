A vitepress site for clean-code-javascript.

## Why I create this project?

clean-code-javascript项目是JavaScript的优秀编程指南。虽然已经过了很长时间，但每次阅读它时，我仍然能够获得新的见解。

The clean-code-javascript project is an excellent programming guide for JavaScript. Although it has been a long time, every time I read it, I still gain new insights.

所以，我为它创建了一个站点，这个站点有可读性更好的UI，以此我希望帮助更多需要阅读clean-code-javascript的前端工程师。

So, I created a website for it. This website has a better UI for readability, and with this, I hope to help more frontend engineers who need to read clean-code-javascript.
